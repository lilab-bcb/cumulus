# Contributing

Contributions of all kinds are welcome. In particular pull requests are appreciated.
The authors will endeavour to help walk you through any issues in the pull request
discussion, so please feel free to open a pull request even if you are new to such things.

## Issues

The easiest contribution to make is to [file an issue](https://github.com/lilab-bcb/cumulus/issues/new).
It is beneficial if you check [Cumulus Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/cumulus-support),
and do a cursory search of [existing issues](https://github.com/lilab-bcb/cumulus/issues).
It is also helpful, if you can provide clear instruction for
how to reproduce a problem. If you have resolved an issue yourself please consider
contributing to us to add your problem, and its resolution, so others can
benefit from your work.

## Documentation

Contributing to documentation is the easiest way to get started. Providing simple
clear or helpful documentation for new users is critical. Anything that *you* as
a new user found hard to understand, or difficult to work out, are excellent places
to begin. Contributions to more detailed and descriptive error messages is
especially appreciated. To contribute to the documentation please
[fork the project](https://github.com/lilab-bcb/cumulus)
into your own repository, make changes there, and then submit a pull request.

## Code

Code contributions are always welcome, from simple bug fixes, to new features. To
contribute code please
[fork the project](https://github.com/lilab-bcb/cumulus)
into your own repository, make changes there, and then submit a pull request. If
you are fixing a known issue please add the issue number to the PR message. If you
are fixing a new issue feel free to file an issue and then reference it in the PR.
You can [browse open issues](https://github.com/lilab-bcb/cumulus/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+) for potential code
contributions.
