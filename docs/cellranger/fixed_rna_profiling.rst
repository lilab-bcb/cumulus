Cellranger multi supports `Fixed RNA Profiling`_ since version 7.0.0.

Sample Sheet
++++++++++++++

#. **Reference** column.

    Prebuilt scRNA-seq references for FRP data processing are summarized below.

    .. list-table::
        :widths: 5 20
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Keyword
          - Description
        * - **GRCh38-2020-A**
          - Human GRCh38 (GENCODE v32/Ensembl 98)

#. *DataType* column.

    Set ``frp`` for RNA-Seq modalities of your FRP samples. For other modalities (e.g. citeseq or antibody), set to their corresponding data types.

#. *ProbeSet* column.

    Preset probe set references for FRP samples:

    .. list-table::
        :widths: 5 20
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Keyword
          - Description
        * - **FRP_human_probe_v1.0.1**
          - FRP probe set v1.0.1 for human. *Only work with Cell Ranger v7.1+*.
        * - **FRP_mouse_probe_v1.0.1**
          - FRP probe set v1.0.1 for mouse. *Only work with Cell Ranger v7.1+*.
        * - **FRP_human_probe_v1**
          - FRP probe set v1.0 for human. Work with Cell Ranger v7.0+.
        * - **FRP_mouse_probe_v1**
          - FRP probe set v1.0 for mouse. Work with Cell Ranger v7.0+.

    If *ProbeSet* column is not set, use **FRP_human_probe_v1.0.1** by default.
    Custom probe set references are also accepted. Simply put the GS or S3 URI of the custom probe set CSV file for this column.

#. *FeatureBarcodeFile* column.

    Provide sample name - Probe Barcode association as follows::

        sample1,BC001|BC002,Control
        sample2,BC003|BC004,Treated

    where the third column (i.e. ``Control`` and ``Treated`` above) is optional, which specifies the description of the samples.

.. note::
  In the case of Singleplex FRP with Antibody Capture, for ``citeseq`` sample, the *FeatureBarcodeFile* you prepare should be in 10x format (see `here <https://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/cell-exp/7.0.0/10k_Human_PBMC_TotalSeqB_singleplex_Multiplex/10k_Human_PBMC_TotalSeqB_singleplex_Multiplex_count_feature_reference.csv>`_ for an example).

#. *Link* column.

    Put a sample unique link name for all modalities that are linked.

    If *Link* column is not set, only consider RNA-seq modalities (i.e. samples of *DataType* ``frp``) and use their *Sample* names as the *Link* names.

#. Example::

    Sample,Reference,ProbeSet,Flowcell,DataType,FeatureBarcodeFile,Link
    sample1,GRCh38-2020-A,FRP_human_probe_v1,/path/to/sample1/fastq/folder,frp,/path/to/sample1/fbf/file,
    sample2_rna,GRCh38-2020-A,FRP_human_probe_v1,/path/to/sample2/rna/fastq/folder,frp,/path/to/sample2/rna/fbf/file,sample2
    sample2_citeseq,GRCh38-2020-A,,/path/to/sample2/citeseq/fastq/folder,citeseq,/path/to/sample2/citeseq/fbf/file,sample2

In the example above, two linked samples are provided.
