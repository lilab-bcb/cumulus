To utilize cellranger arc/cellranger multi/cellranger count for single-cell multiomics, follow the specific instructions below. In particular, we put each single modality in one separate lin in the sample sheet as described above. We then use the *Link* column to link multiple modalities together. Depending on the modalities included, *cellranger arc* (Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression), *cellranger multi* (CellPlex), or *cellranger count* (Feature Barcode) will be triggered. Note that cumulus_feature_barcoding/demuxEM would not be triggered for hashing/citeseq in this setting.

Sample sheet
++++++++++++

#. **Reference** column.

	Pre-built Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression references are summarized below. CellPlex and Feature Barcode use the same reference as in Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq.

#. *DataType* column.

	For each modality, set it to the corresponding data type.

#. *FetureBarcodeFile* column.

	For RNA-seq modality, only set this if a target panel is provided.
	For CMO (CellPlex), provide sample name - CMO tag association as follows::

		sample1,CMO301|CMO302
		sample2,CMO303

	For CITESeq, Perturb-seq and hashing, provide one CSV file as defined in `Feature Barcode Reference`_. Note that one feature barcode reference should be provided for all feature-barcode related modalities (e.g. *citeseq*, *hashing*, *crispr*) and all these modalities should put the same reference file in *FeatureBarcodeFile* column.

#. *Link* column.

	Put a sample unique link name for all modalities that are linked.

#. Example::
