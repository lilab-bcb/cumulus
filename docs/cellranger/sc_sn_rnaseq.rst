Cell 2020]`_ (https://github.com/hyeshik/sars-cov-2-transcriptome, BetaCov/South Korea/KCDC03/2020 based on NC_045512.2). The GTF was edited to include only CDS regions, and regions were added to describe the 5' UTR ("SARSCoV2_5prime"), the 3' UTR ("SARSCoV2_3prime"), and reads aligning to anywhere within the Negative Strand("SARSCoV2_NegStrand"). Additionally, trailing A's at the 3' end of the virus were excluded from the SARSCoV2 fasta, as these were found to drive spurious viral alignment in pre-COVID19 samples.
