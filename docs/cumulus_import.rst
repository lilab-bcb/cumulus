Import workflows to Terra
------------------------------------

Cumulus workflows are hosted on Dockstore_ under the organization of *Li Lab*. In this tutorial, we'll use *Cellranger* workflow for illustration to show how to import Cumulus workflows to your Terra workspace.

1. `Cumulus collection of workflows`_ lists all workflows in Cumulus. For purpose of illustration, we will describe process of importing Demultiplexing workflow in Terra. Click on View button beside "github.com/lilab-bcb/cumulus/Demultiplexing".

2. Switch version using the Versions tab. In "Git Reference column", you can optionally select the appropriate version to import into Terra or use the default. Then Launch with Terra (illustrated below).

3. Optionally rename the workflow and select a workspace on Terra where you have access to execute workflows and click IMPORT. This will take you to Terra from where you can launch the workflow by providing required inputs.
